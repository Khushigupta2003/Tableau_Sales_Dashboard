# Tableau_Sales_Dashboard
Using Super Store data set  a dashboard has been created using Visuals , Calculated fields  ,  dropdowns and many advance features of tableau are used in making Automated dashboard.
Analysis which I came across:
Average sales by year , Average Profit by year , Average Quantity Sold by YEAR , Average Qunatity returned by Year  for the selected category 
Profit by region for each category , year and percentage of composition
In 2022 , Technology products were highest selling products but in April Month there was a loss of 2640 amount
In 2022 , office supplies items were highly returned as 1865 is the total quantity returned.
and many other insights are there . Dashboard is full of advance actions and all headings are perfectly dynamic
